# Weather Checker

Weather Checker is a simple web application that allows users to check the current weather of a city. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The application consists of a single HTML page (see :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}) that includes:
- A form to input a city name.
- A submit button that triggers the weather check.
- A results area to display the weather information.

The JavaScript logic is contained in `script1.js`, and styling is managed via `styles.css`.

## Features

- **City Input:** Users can enter the name of a city.
- **Weather Information:** Upon submission, the app fetches and displays weather details (assuming API integration in `script1.js`).
- **Responsive Design:** The simple layout is designed to work well on different devices.
